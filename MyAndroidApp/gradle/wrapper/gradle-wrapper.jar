The gradle-wrapper.jar file is a binary file that is generated by the Gradle build system and cannot be manually created or represented in text format. It is typically included in the project when you set up the Gradle wrapper. 

To generate this file, you would normally run a command like `gradle wrapper` in your project directory, which will create the necessary wrapper files, including gradle-wrapper.jar.

If you need to include this file in your project, please ensure that you run the appropriate Gradle command to generate it.
