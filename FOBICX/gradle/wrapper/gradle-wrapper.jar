The gradle-wrapper.jar file is a binary file and cannot be generated as text content. It is typically included in the project by downloading the appropriate version of Gradle. You can obtain the gradle-wrapper.jar file by running the Gradle wrapper command in your project directory, which will automatically download the necessary files.

If you need to create a new Android app, you can set up the project structure and files as specified, but the gradle-wrapper.jar file itself should be obtained from the Gradle distribution.
